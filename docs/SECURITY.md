# üõ°Ô∏è Security Practices

This document outlines the security controls, secret handling mechanisms, and compliance mapping implemented within the AI-Powered Portfolio project. Our approach focuses on shifting security left, automating checks, and adhering to industry best practices.

## üöÄ DevSecOps Practices

We integrate security into every stage of the development lifecycle through automated scans and continuous integration practices:

*   **Automated Scans in CI:** We utilize automated security scanning tools within our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early.
*   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Pre-commit hooks (e.g., `git-secrets`, `truffleHog`) are employed to prevent sensitive credentials from being committed to the repository.
*   **GitHub Secret Scanning:** Regular GitHub secret scanning is enabled to detect any accidental exposure of secrets.
*   **OWASP DevSecOps Guidelines:** Our practices align with OWASP DevSecOps guidelines, emphasizing pre-commit and CI scans to ensure secrets never enter the repository.

## üîë Secrets Management

Secure handling of API keys and sensitive tokens is paramount. We employ a multi-layered approach:

*   **GitHub Actions Secrets:** All API keys and tokens (e.g., Cloudflare API token, OpenAI key, Pinecone key, Notion token) are stored as encrypted GitHub Actions secrets. These secrets are never exposed in logs or code.
*   **Cloudflare Workers Secrets:** Values used by Cloudflare Workers are managed via Cloudflare's Secrets store (using `wrangler secrets`).
*   **Local Development:** For local development, `.env` or `.dev.vars` files are used to store secrets. These files are explicitly gitignored to prevent them from being committed to version control.

## üìä Observability

Robust observability is crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents and operational issues:

*   **Sentry Integration:** We integrate Sentry for comprehensive error monitoring. The build pipeline uploads source maps (configured via `upload_source_maps = true` in `wrangler.toml`) to enable de-minified stack traces.
*   **Unhandled Exceptions:** All unhandled exceptions in both Workers and frontend code are captured by Sentry, providing immediate alerts and context for investigations.

## üèÜ OWASP Top 10 Adherence

Our code is reviewed against the OWASP Top 10 risks to mitigate common web application vulnerabilities:

*   **A1: Broken Access Control:** Mitigated by enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), token scopes, and robust server-side checks.
*   **A2: Cryptographic Failures:** Addressed by enforcing TLS, regular key rotation, and storing secrets securely in GitHub Secrets and Cloudflare Workers secrets.
*   **A3: Injection:** Prevented through rigorous input validation, sanitization, and the use of parameterized database calls.
*   **A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Mitigated by implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) and sanitizing all rendered HTML and user-generated content.
*   **A8: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Addressed by using CSRF tokens for stateful endpoints or enforcing same-site cookie policies.

## üìú Compliance Mapping (SOC 2 & GDPR)

We map our security controls to relevant compliance standards:

*   **SOC 2:** We maintain documentation for system descriptions and control matrices, covering:
    *   **Access Control Policies:** Defined and enforced.
    *   **Change Management:** Tracked via GitHub and CI/CD audits.
    *   **Incident Response:** Documented procedures leveraging Sentry logs.
    *   **Confidentiality:** Ensured through encrypted secrets and secure data handling.
    All production data access is logged and monitored to satisfy SOC 2 requirements.
*   **GDPR:** Personal data (if any, stored in Notion or other databases) is identified and processed lawfully. We provide clear data deletion flows and implement data minimization principles. Cloudflare's EU data residency options are utilized where applicable.

In summary, we follow secure coding and deployment guidelines, use encrypted secret stores, and implement monitoring for rapid incident response.
